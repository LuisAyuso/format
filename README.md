C++ compile time tools to format string literals (experiment)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LuisAyuso/format.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LuisAyuso/format)

Inspiration comes from: https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2011/05/11/parsing-strings-at-compile-time-part-i/
This entry is the first time I found how to read string literals in compile time, it is not stable but you can get far already.
